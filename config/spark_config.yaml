# Spark Configuration for UK Land Registry Pipeline (30.9M Rows)
# Requirement: Resource allocation justification

spark_settings:
  app_name: "UK_Property_ML_Pipeline"
  
  # Resource Allocation (Justification: Optimized for 6.2GB Parquet dataset)
  master: "local[*]"
  executor_memory: "8g"        # Sufficient to hold serialized shuffle blocks
  driver_memory: "4g"          # Handles the final evaluation metric collection
  executor_cores: 4            # Balanced for parallelism vs. context switching
  
  # Shuffle & Partition Tuning (Requirement 1c)
  sql_shuffle_partitions: 200  # Default for large datasets to avoid small file problems
  default_parallelism: 8       # Double the core count for task pipelining
  
  # Serialization & Performance
  serializer: "org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer"
  memory_fraction: 0.6         # 60% of RAM for execution/storage
